        <p class="ingredients">Procedure</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the lasagna pasta. Drain. Lasagna noodles need structure—they have a lot of ingredients layered between them!
                —so they can't be too mushy. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente. Check out the packaging and cook 
                it for two-thirds of the recommended time. Since you will be baking the entire lasagna in the oven after you layer it,
                your pasta will continue cooking, so give it a place to go! Overcooked pasta does not a good lasagna make.</li>
            <li>In a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Season the beef as desired. Pour off any fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 3 tablespoons parsley, basil, fennel, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich. The most important part of this whole things is her sauce. It’s rich with flavour and texture. Using tomato paste results in a thick and rich sauce. Don&#8217;t skip this ingredient!</li>
            <li>Make the cheese filling. In a small bowl, mix egg, ricotta cheese, and remaining parsley and salt. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
            <li>In baking dish, placing a layer of meat sauce under the first layer of noodles will help prevent the noodles from sticking to the bottom of the baking dish. Layer with three noodles and a third of the ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. I don’t recommend using fresh mozzarella because all different brands have different moisture levels and it can affect the finished product. If you do want to use fresh mozzarella, be sure to slice it thin and press out all the extra moisture in paper towels. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
