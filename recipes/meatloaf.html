          <ul class="li_right">
             <li> 1/2 Pounds Ground Beef</li>
             <li>2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar</li>
             <li>2 Tablespoons Prepared Mustard</li>
             <li> Cup Dried Bread Crumbssalt And Pepper To Tast</li>

        <p class="ingredients">Procedure</p>
        <ol>
             <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
             <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, egg, onion, milk and bread OR cracker crumbs. Use your hands to mush and mix these ingredients together until well combined.  Don't mash or the meatloaf will be dense, mix lightly. Some people like to use a wooden spoon, but I find your hands are the best tools for the job.  Wear latex/nitrile gloves if you donâ€™t want meatloaf hands.Also, be sure to moisten the cracker crumbs or bread crumbs before adding them to the meatloaf.</li>
             <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste and place in a lightly greased 5x9 inch loaf pan, OR form into a loaf and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
             <li>I also like to coat my meatloaf with a glaze which adds an extra something-something to the meatloaf both in looks and flavour.  In a separate small bowl, combine the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup. Mix well and pour the glaze over the meatloaf into a uniform layer.</li>
             <li>Place sheet pan on the center rack of oven, bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degree Celsius) for 1 hour. A pan of hot water in the oven, under the meat loaf, will keep the top from cracking.  Stand for 10 minutes before turning out and cutting into thick slices.  You will probably get a bit of crumbling just on the edges of the first couple of slices, this is normal and indicative of the tenderness and juiciness of the meatloaf (zero crumble indicates firm packed harder meatloaf which isn't as enjoyable!).</li>
